## About the Game of Life

## Goals

The standard presentation of the Game of Life, which was initially developed by Conley (insert full name), is done by creating a grid of asterisks, or some other marker, and a relief entity. My take on this involves using `1` & `0` as the markers and making the expected two-dimensional grid into a one-dimensional line. I intend to create a flat time series of the grown cells and present that within a Plotly dash application time-series visualization. I suspect that this perspective will show patterns not easily seen within the classic game of life model.
