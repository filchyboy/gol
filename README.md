## About the Game of Life

## Goals

Standard presentation of the Game of Life which was originally developed by Conley (insert full name) is done by creating a grid of astericks, or some other marker, and a relief entity. My take on this involves using `1` & `0` as the markers and making the normal 2 dimensional grid into a 1 dimensional line. My intent behind this is to create a flat time series of the grown of cells and presnt that within a plotly dash application time series visualization. I suspect that this perspective will show patterns not easily seen within the standard game of life model.
